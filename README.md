# FINAL PROJECT JS ADVANCED Hacker News
You will go on to develop an application to democratize the dissemination of information in the tech sector through the use of the <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Hacker News</a> service.

At startup, the application will have to display the list of the latest news available by displaying the title, the link and the date of the news. He will then have to contact the API (as per the documentation) of the external Hacker News service to retrieve the list of latest news IDs. For each ID, the application will have to contact another API of the Hacker News service to obtain the information to be displayed such as the title, link and date of the news.

If the user clicks on the "Load more" button, the application will have to take the next 10 ids from the list and make the API call for the detail.
